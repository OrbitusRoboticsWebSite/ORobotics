# Rodolfo Aramayo

## Senior iOS/macOS Developer



I am a developer for macOS/iOS/watchOS/VisionOS. I have
dedicated all my time and resources throughout my professional
career to perfecting my craft of delivering amazing software with
Swift, SwiftUI and Objcetive-C. I was on the Apple hardware team
writing and debugging automation tools infrastructure in order to
facilitate the testing of the latest products to the world. I have had the
privilege to work with the most powerful frameworks ever created for
the Apple ecosystem and am honored to have had a chance to touch
the insides of these devices for over 2.6 years. Before this I worked
with the Apple Store app and Caffé Macs in my previous positions
at Apple. I delivered some of the most cutting edge AR experiences
ranging from Sports Illustrated, AR cinema experiences for movies
like Ready Player One, and even AR Experiences for Comopolitan.
I try to hone my craft by working on my passion project, R.O.B. A
droid that utilizes a Mac mini in order to test my realtime software
engineering skills along with my mechanical engineering skills. I
have always tried to push the boundaries of AR and Robotics. I have
been to MakerFaire multiple times with my droid and strive to inspire
and encourage young engineers to live their dreams and enjoy the
love and excitement of writing code that moves and talks with the
latest LLM models like ChatGPT and Gemini. I am a father of 7
children and a husband to a wonderful wife. Please follow our droid
on social media

at Apple. I also helped our client at Macy's navigate to their next by migrating
their existing IBM CoreMetrics analytics to Adobe analytics within our budgeted

paramount that we provided a crash free and flawless migration. Let us help

framework was used at many brand name department stores you might be
familiar with for in-store payments with iOS iPod touch devices: Apple Store,
Abercrombie & Fitch, Sears, Hollister, etc... www.starmount.com has become

## MindTree

Web Architect

October 2014 - March 2015 (6 months)

Austin, TX

I developed http://help.ea.com
frontend UI and salesforce backend (EA's help website for its millions of
gamers, internationally). Ranging from their hot titles at the time, we made sure
each was delivered with a cutting edge user experience that would connect
our gamer customers to the team of assistance personnel. We also tailored the
custom assistance personal javascript webapp, written in-house by one of they
former web architects, that used salesforce backends to manage live chat with
EA customers as well as financial payment transactions.

## Klink

macOS Developer

September 2012 - August 2014 (2 years)

Austin, TX

Klink is the exact replica of DropBox but it was based in indonesia for
a telecom company. I was in charge of the macOS version of the file
management application. This involved the dark art of reverse engineering
the Finder to install custom icon hooks that delivered the same features
that DropBox did when overriding the Finder's icon's so you could see the
cloud status. Swizzling mach methods in objective C mixed with a python file
management engine required some advanced macOS knowledge to perform.

## Guidelight Business Solutions

Mobile App Developer

January 2012 - July 2012 (7 months)

715 Discovery Blvd, suite 306 Ceder Park, Texas

Enterprise software development. I worked on architecting and implementing
enterprise grade solutions for large business clients. I not oly architected
their iOS projects but was the lead responsible for OSX development as well.

Purchasables for the client to sell.

## Appiction LLC

iOS Developer

March 2010 - September 2011 (1 year 7 months)

Austin, TX

iOS/Web Developer. Appiction started out as only a startup company. It was
through my hard work and Spencer Forest's cunning silver-tongue that we
became MutualMobile's most vicious competitor in Austin. We outbid them for
millions of dollars in contracts, right from under their feet.
While at Appiction, I was tasked with cleaning up the current projects that
were outsourced and not working, my career was based on rebuilding and
rearchitecting those client applications from the ground up. Working with
Page 4 of 6
large teams of masterful artists, I helped develop and implement inter-
team dependencies that streamlined the production of more than 40 major
projects for the company. I built and architected over 15 of those projects
from the ground up working with iOS technology, video graphics editors,
AVFoundation, javascript - cocoa web app integration bridges. I helped train
new programmers and managed their progress. I showed extreme initiative
to get the team together and unify. I initiated gatherings with delicious home-
cooked food to bring the people of the team together. www.appiction.com has
become www.appsaustin.com

## Mutual Mobile

iOS Developer

December 2009 - March 2010 (4 months)

Austin, TX

iOS developer in the booming mobile development industry. They were paying
very little at the time and the industry was gaining so much momentum. I
worked on client requested apps with a team of artists and project managers.
Airometer was a hobbs meter for iOS that would track airplane flight hours
around the iOS 3.0 days. I jumped ship to Appiction because of the lack of
available hours at work which ended up being a great move.

## GameSalad, Inc

iOS OpenGLES Developer

December 2007 - November 2009 (2 years)

Austin, TX

iOS / Mac OpenGL and OpenGLES graphics software engineer at
GameSalad. I was 1 of 4 founding members that started the entire company,
as a contractor I was not entitled to anything except the lessons on how to be
a professional iOS contract developer. I have not stopped contracting ever
since I was there when we decided to make the icon, we chose blue first but it
became purple. Great work Yoshi (Josh Seymour). I wrote their first OpenGL
ES Asteroids demo, when first and second round of funding was still 2 years
away, with Dan Treiman before the first Apple iOS SDK was ever released.
We had to push our code through the command line on the first generation
iPhone. Separately, I also worked on QTV (a Playstation product). This was
my introduction into the professional programming environment.
